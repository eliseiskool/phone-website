    <h2>Phone contracts</h2>
    <h5> What is a phone contract?</h5>
    <p>Phone contracts, also known as mobile phone contracts or cell phone contracts, are agreements between a mobile network provider and a consumer. These contracts typically involve a monthly fee in exchange for a package of services that include a mobile phone handset, a certain number of voice call minutes, text messages, and a data allowance.

      When signing a phone contract, consumers commit to a specific duration, usually 12, 18, or 24 months. During this period, they are required to make regular monthly payments as per the agreed-upon terms. In return, they receive the benefits and services included in the contract, such as a subsidized or discounted phone, network coverage, and a specific allocation of minutes, texts, and data.
      
      Phone contracts offer convenience and affordability to consumers who prefer spreading out the cost of a new phone over a fixed period rather than paying for the device upfront. These contracts often include additional perks such as access to exclusive deals, customer support, and the ability to upgrade to newer handsets during or after the contract term.
      
      It's important to carefully review the terms and conditions of a phone contract, including the monthly costs, duration, included services, and any potential penalties for early termination or exceeding the allocated limits. This helps consumers make an informed decision and choose a contract that best suits their needs and budget.</p>
